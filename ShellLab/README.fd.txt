This is my lab shell where will do some commands that a a shell usually does.

This works well, It has bugs in the Path part (ex if you try cat /Tryout/speech.txt) does not find the document. But the pipe, and redirection works ( for pipe I did ls |wc
or cat speech.txt | wc) so pipe works but I only have a hard time doing the path.
